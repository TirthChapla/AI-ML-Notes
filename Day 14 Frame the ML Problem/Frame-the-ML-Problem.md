# Netflix : (How to increase Revenue)

* three ways mainly 
  * Bring the new customers.
  * Increase the price 
  * <span style="color:green"> Stop the customer that are leaving </span>


## Churn Rate :
 
- How many customer we are loosing.

    100%
      |- 2% loose
          |
          98%     
           |- 2% loose
           96%

- like this we are loosing but we think then the compnay fails 
    * <span style="color:red"> ***The customer joining rate is more***   </span>


* Assume if the CHURN Rate is 4% 
  
  * <span style="color:blue"> We have to decrease to the 3.75</span>
